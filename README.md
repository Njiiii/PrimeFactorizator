# PrimeFactorizator
I wrote this program to relearn some Python, as I have mostly used Java and C# in the last couple of years.

# Purpose
In mathematics there is a theorem called Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
This theroem states, that every integer greater than 1 can be represented as a product of two or more prime numbers. First versions of this theorem can be found in Euclid's Elements and the proof is a bit too complicated to be written here but you can find it from:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic#Proof

This program takes a number given by user and outputs it as a multiplication of prime numbers.
For example if user gives "5040", then the program would output "5040 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7"
